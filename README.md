# Test ðŸŒŸ

A directory of all my Object Pascal Test repositories.

I hope this will help someone with my captured knowledge on the below subjects.

## The List

### Test Application Demo

- [Repository](https://github.com/gcarreno/TestApplicationDemo)

A boiler plate on how to do Application config the "Lazarus Way â„¢".

It includes:

- Setting up what properties to save on `TForm.SessionProperties`
- `TINIPropStorage` for `TForm.SessionProperties` property storage
- `TFileExit` action with different shortcuts for Windows and Linux
- The use of `GetAppConfigFile()` to get the app's default file customised for Linux/Windows
- A way to have different short cuts for exit in Linux(CTRL+Q) and Windows(ALT+X)

### Test Download with Progress Bar

- [Repository](https://github.com/gcarreno/TestDownloadProgressBar)

Example of `fphttpclient` with a progress bar.
