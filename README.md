I hope this will help someone with my captured knowledge on the below subjects.

## âœ¨ Test Application Demo

> [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gcarreno/TestApplicationDemo)


A boiler plate on how to do Application config the "Lazarus Way (tm)".

It includes:

- Setting up what properties to save on `TForm.SessionProperties`
- `TINIPropStorage` for `TForm.SessionProperties` property storage
- `TFileExit` action with different shortcuts for Windows and Linux
- The use of `GetAppConfigFile()` to get the app's default file customised for Linux/Windows
- A way to have different short cuts for exit in Linux(CTRL+Q) and Windows(ALT+X)

[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/gcarreno/TestIPScanner/total)](https://github.com/gcarreno/TestIPScanner/releases)

An attempt to do a graphical application to scan a range of IPs and some other tools.

This entry on the [Test ðŸŒŸ](https://github.com/gcarreno/TestStar) list is inspired by this repository: [IPAvailabilityScanner](https://github.com/vrwallace/IPAvailabilityScanner).

It implements:
1. Retrieving the machine's Public IP address from one of these providers:
    - http://ifconfig.me
    - http://ifconfig.co
    - http://ipecho.net/plain
    - http://checkip.amazonaws.com
2. Performing an IP scan on a range of IPs ( Not Implemented yet ).
3. Performing a Ping ( Not Implemented yet ).
4. Performing a Trace Route ( Not Implemented yet ).

This application is also using the Property Storage on an `INI` file. It stores the size of the Window and some values like the last selected tab and the last inputs on several edits.

### Important Details

#### Linux

In order to perform a Ping the packet needs to be in raw mode. This implies it needs super user permissions.

If you want Ping and TraceRoute to work you must run the program with `sudo`:

```console
$ sudo bin/TestIPScanner
```

#### Windows

This has been tested under Windows 11 and it is working on both non and "Run as User".

Many thanks to [ikel](https://github.com/ikelaiah) for doing the tests.

#### macOS

I'm unable to test under macOS so I'll need some help here.

### Known bugs

- The IP Edit component needs to be focused in order to refresh internal fields right after starting up the application.
    For some reason, when the `TINIPropStorage` fills in the `TIPEdit.Text` property, the component does not refresh the internal fields.

## âœ¨ Test Peer-to-Peer

> [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/gcarreno/TestPeer-to-Peer)


> **Disclaimer**
>
> In the spirit of full disclosure and due to my utter laziness in coming up with the bulk of the boilerplate code, I turned to `ChatGPT`.\
> You can see the series of prompts and answers I've got in the [research](research) folder.

This is an attempt at a very basic peer class that can participate on a Peer-to-Peer( `P2P` ) network.

It will not have peer discovery via `UDP` broadcast, nor will it have any `DHT` features.

Just a simple message exchange protocol in a `P2P` context.

### Todo

- The `TPeer` class, at the moment, does not need to be a thread
- Hook up event for data received from connection thread to the internal peer method
- Add a property to allow hooking to data received from outside of the peer
- Hook up event for connection removal from connection thread to peer
- Understand if a connection needs to be disconnected when being removed
- Implement command line switch `--connect-to`
- Ponder having a Ping/Pong immediately before a connection is about to timeout

The code is taken from Thaddy de Koning's entry on the [Free Pascal Wiki](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Marsaglia%27s_pseudo_random_number_generators).

I'm using an MIT License for the time being. Need to have a talk with Thaddy to sort that out.

Example of how to use the Class `TThread` and all of the threading tools available with Free Pascal.

### Single Thread, Single Instance

This exemplifies the most basic use of a thread.

It declares an event to hook into the main form.

This is a single shot use because we set the thread's `FreeOnTerminate` property to True.

### Single Thread, Many Instances

The example above isn't of much use if we just run a single instance.

In this example we create multiple instances of the same thread and we start them concurrently.

This is, **also**, a single shot use because we set the thread's `FreeOnTerminate` property to True.
